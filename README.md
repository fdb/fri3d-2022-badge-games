# Fri3D Camp 2022 Badge Games

A bunch of games for the [Fri3D Camp 2022](https://fri3d.be/) badge. You don't need the Game On attachment (as I didn't have one either), you can play these using the capacitive touch pins on the board itself.

To setup the badge for development:

1. First, follow the instructions in the [Fri3d Arduino badge repository](https://github.com/Fri3dCamp/Badge2020_arduino) (the year says 2020, but the camp got postponed due to the Corona pandemic).
2. Open the .ino file in Arduino.
3. Choose the correct USB port
4. Run Upload to upload the game to the Arduino.
